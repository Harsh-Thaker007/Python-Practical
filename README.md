# Python-Practical


## 1. Write a program for computing GCD of 2 numbers with optimal data structures and less time-consuming.
 <b>constraints:</b>
``` 
        - For loop is not allowed

        - input should be in words:

            - e.g.: onetwo = 12, sixone = 61

        - words will be within zero to nine

        - Cannot use inbuilt methods like max, min, or any math function    
```      

 
## 2. Given n pairs of parentheses, write a function to generate all combinations of well-formed parentheses.
  
 
 <b>constraints:</b>

        - 1 <= n <= 8

    Example 1:

        - Input: n = 3

        - Output: ["((()))","(()())","(())()","()(())","()()()"]

     
        
## 3. Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

<b>Constraints:</b>
    

        - 1 <= strs.length <= 104

        - 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100

        - strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

    Example 1:

        - Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

        - Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
